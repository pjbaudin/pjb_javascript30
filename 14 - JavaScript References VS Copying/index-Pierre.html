    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. 
    // They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(cap2, person)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {
      ...person

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    //  lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
